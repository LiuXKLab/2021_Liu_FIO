## Key CKI-perturbed immune-related genes and their prognostic values

### The prognostic value of the five-gene signature

- The distribution of risk scores, survival time, status and prognostic gene expression patterns for the 298 patients in the testing set or the 107 patients in the test set.
- Kaplan-Meier curves of patients in the high- and low-risk groups in the METABRIC cohort or the GSE58812 cohort. 
- ROC analysis of the five-gene signature for predicting survival risks in the training set or the test set.
- Time-dependent C-index or ROC curves with two Cox proportional hazards models for DSS; one included two covariates (tumor size and number of positive lymph nodes), and the other added risk scores as covariates. The C-index was internally validated using Bootstrap cross validation for 1000 times. The significant difference in the C-index and AUC was observed after one year.
